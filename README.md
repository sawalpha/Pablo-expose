# Pablo-expose
**Pablo took a screenshot from my real launcher and published a fake source code pretending it’s mine.
That code is not my launcher — it’s his, and it contains a virus.
He’s trying to scam people using my launcher’s name to spread malware and hack them.
I’ll expose him and show the real proof**
