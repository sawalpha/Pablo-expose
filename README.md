# Pablo Expose

Pablo took a screenshot from my **real launcher** and published a **fake source code**, pretending it’s mine.  
That code is **not** my launcher — it’s **his**, and it contains a **virus**.  
He’s trying to **scam people** using my launcher’s name to spread malware and hack them.  
I’ll expose him and show the real proof soon.

### 🧾 The Fake Leak
**File ID:** `507640216-684907d8-058c-4908-ba43-3360ad2a7c5e`  
This is part of the **fake source** Pablo shared. It’s **not my launcher**.

### ⚠️ Overcharging & Scamming
He’s also charging **$60** for a launcher that **barely works**, and he can **delete the source (offline or online)** anytime after people pay.

**File ID:** `507654253-125d2aff-08a2-4a9c-a3e2-6d055e944d7e`  
Avoid buying anything from him — it’s a scam.
